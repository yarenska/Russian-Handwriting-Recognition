# Russian-Handwriting-Recognition

Firstly, I downloaded a .rar file that contains the all Cyrillic characters. Then, I converted
them into a proper form so that my deep learning algorithm can understand. By means of that, I converted them into a numeric values to a dataframe named “letters.csv”. Then, I applied my deep learning algorithm with the keras package that Python provided to us. It is a summary of my project and I want to extend my project and implement the nearly equivalent one of the Google Translate Russian version and integrate it to a mobile application using React Native so that my application works both on iOS and Android devices.
